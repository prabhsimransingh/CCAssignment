Chapter 6
6.1. We can take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 from bottle 2, and so on. This would allow us to have weighted average from each bottle. Our expected weight will be: 
1+2+…+20 = (20 * 21)/ 2 = 210 grams.
So using the formula:
Weight – 210 grams / 0.1 grams
So, if set of pills weighed 210.3. So Bottle # 3 would have the heavy pills.
6.2 Basketball
Probability of winning game 1 is p
Probability of winning game 2 is if we make 2 out of 3 shots and 3 out of 3 shots.
This probability is 3p2 – 2p3
So, we should play Game 1 if 0 < p < .5 and Game 2 if .5 < p < 1
This is because probability of winning game1 is 0.5 and second is 0.66.
6.3 Dominos
After removing diagonally opposite corners we are left with either 30 black and 32 white or 32 black and 30 white square. Hence, it is impossible to cover all the squares. Each domino will exactly cover one black and one white square. Therefore, 31 dominos will cover exactly 31 white and 31 black squares.
6.4 Ants on a triangle.
The only way ants won’t collide is if they all move in the same direction. 
P(col) = 1 – P(same Dir)
=1 – ¼ = ¾ that they will collide
For N sided polygon
P(col) = 1 – P(same dir) = 1 – (½)n-1





6.5 Jugs of water

Following are the steps to follow:

5 Quart Jug	3 Quart Jug 	Action 
5	0 	Fill 5 quart to full
2	3	Pour 5 quart into 3 quart
0	2	Empty 3 quart and pour 5 quart contents into 3 quart

5	2	Fill 5 quart jug
4	3	Fill 3 quart jug
4	0 	Dump 3 quart jug, we have 4 quarts.

6.6 Blue – Eyed Island
If the number of people having blue eyes is 1, they will look around and realize no one has blue eyes and they will leave on the first night.

Continuing with the same logic, if c men will have blue they will all leave c nights to leave.
6.9 100 lockers
Observations:
Door n is open/closed for each factor of n. For locker 15 open/ closed on 1, 3, 5, 15 round.
Door is open if odd rounds and factors. Like door 1.
X is odd when it is perfect square. Eg – 36.
Number of perfect squares – 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 49, 64	, 81,100 = > 10 
Therefore, 10 lockers are open at the end.
